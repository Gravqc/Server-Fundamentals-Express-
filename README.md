# Client-Server Interaction:

- Client makes an HTTP request to the server.
- Client-side code requests data from the server-side application (Express API).
- Express API receives the request, performs business logic, retrieves/pushes data, and responds to the client.
- Example: Restaurant Scenario
  Client: Orders food.
  Server: Waiter (server) asks for the order, relays it to the kitchen (server room), and returns with the food (response).

# Route

- Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
- Client will make requests to those routes that are defined in your server

# Get Requests:

- Get data using a get request

When you want to query the server for some data.

- The "/"
  app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.status(201).send({ msg: "Message" });
  });

# Route Params:

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

- ex: localhost/api/users/4; 4 being the route param

# Query Params:

- Extra bits at the end of a URL (e.g., form inputs, search bar)
- ex: localhost/products?key=value&key2=value2

# POST Request:

- Post data using a post request
- Creat a resource on the backend, and that backend will save it to some db, or some file, etc.

# Middleware:

- Certain functions that are going to get invoked before certain api requests are handled

# Put & Patch Request:

- Both are used to update data but differ on how they update data
- Patch: Updates a record partially(for ex: updating one field in the entry/row)
- Put: Update the record in its entirety (for ex if you want to update just one attribute then you would have to pass the old value again so that the attribute values that you dont want to change dont get overwritten)

# Delete Request:

- Delete records from the database
