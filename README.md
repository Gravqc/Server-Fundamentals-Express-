# Client-Server Interaction:

- Client makes an HTTP request to the server.
- Client-side code requests data from the server-side application (Express API).
- Express API receives the request, performs business logic, retrieves/pushes data, and responds to the client.
- Example: Restaurant Scenario
  Client: Orders food.
  Server: Waiter (server) asks for the order, relays it to the kitchen (server room), and returns with the food (response).

# Route

- Define/register routes, Route can be thought of as a path in your serverapp ex:localhosttest.com/users will give users, localhosttest.com/products,etc
- Client will make requests to those routes that are defined in your server

# Requests:

- Get
- Post
- Delete
- Put
