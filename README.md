# Intro & Setup

- Client <-> Server
- Client will make a http(hyper transfer text protocol) request to the server.
- The code on client side will make request to server side application (express api)
- express api will receive the request. And now the server will perform some business logic and retrieve/push and respond to the client
- ex: Restaurant:
  - Client: Ordering food
  - Server: Waiter will ask the client what you want to eat, client will request
  - Waiter will send the request back to the kitchen(server room) and after some time the waiter will come back with your order
